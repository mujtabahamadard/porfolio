            In this alternate universe, Nayeon, Chaeyoung, and Jeongyeon from TWICE live for the thrill of the night. Their friendship is rooted in their shared love for living life on the edge, celebrating every moment like it's their last. On weekends, they hit the neon-lit streets, dressed in their finest, moving from one underground club to another. The music pulses through their veins, and their laughter echoes as they dance together, letting the world blur around them. Nayeon is the vibrant heart of the trio, always hyping up her friends, while Chaeyoung, the bold and creative spirit, brings an unpredictable energy to every night out. Jeongyeon is their protector—fierce, but always steady, ensuring they stay safe while keeping the fun alive.

They’re inseparable, knowing that no matter what, they’ve got each other’s backs. Life feels untouchable when they're together, and every celebration is their own little rebellion against the mundane. But in the midst of their endless nights of music, drinks, and laughter, something begins to change—small whispers on the news about strange outbreaks in nearby cities. The trio shrugs it off, thinking the chaos is far from their bubble of fun. They’re too caught up in the glow of their world to notice the small signs creeping in: the odd looks from strangers, the growing unease in the air.

One night, as they sit around a rooftop, drinks in hand, Nayeon jokingly suggests the world might end soon, and they all laugh it off. Jeongyeon teases her about always being dramatic, while Chaeyoung snaps a selfie with the city skyline in the background. Little do they know, as the city lights flicker in the distance, their perfect world is already unraveling.

The streets they once ruled will soon be abandoned. The clubs they danced in will fall silent. And the bond they cherish will be tested in ways they never imagined as the looming zombie outbreak creeps closer, unseen and unstoppable, until it’s too late.

            By 2475, Jennie from BLACKPINK has perfected the art of the hunt. Centuries of immortality have sharpened her senses, but it’s her timeless beauty and undeniable charm that make her the ultimate predator. Her appearance hasn’t aged a day since 2024—her porcelain skin glows under the moonlight, her dark eyes gleam with an intoxicating allure, and her movements are graceful, calculated, like a panther stalking its prey.

Late at night, she walks the shadowy streets, blending into the bustling nightlife, where no one suspects her true nature. Her hunger burns within her, but Jennie never rushes. She’s learned to be patient, to savor the chase. Dressed in the latest fashion, her look is a hypnotic blend of modern elegance and a subtle, mysterious edge. With a smile that promises both danger and desire, she can effortlessly draw people in.

Jennie doesn’t need to say much—her presence alone is magnetic. A soft touch on her victim’s arm, a lingering gaze that speaks of forbidden pleasure, and they are hers. She makes her victims feel special, as if they've stumbled upon a moment with a living legend. Her voice, soft and velvety, lulls them into a false sense of security as she pulls them into the darkness.

Once they are close enough, intoxicated by her charm and beauty, Jennie strikes with precision. Her bite is swift, leaving them in a state of bliss as she drains their life force. When the night ends, Jennie disappears into the shadows, her hunger satisfied—for now. By dawn, no one remembers her, and her legend only grows, the centuries passing like moments in her eternal life as a vampire.
